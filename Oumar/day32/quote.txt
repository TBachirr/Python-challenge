I think it’s best to start by having huge dreams. That way, even if the dream is shattered, you are left with all the pieces that are left behind it.– Taehyun
Please stop thinking about such trouble things when you go to bed. Give yourself compliments that you’ve to work hard. 
You’re not a burden, even if you think that the world hates you, you’re precious to people that I like and me, so please don’t say that.
No matter how bad those people are and no matter how bad things they say, I don’t want to spend my time and energy being angry at that person.
You’re born in this world, and you’re a precious one. I hope you put priority on your happiness.
